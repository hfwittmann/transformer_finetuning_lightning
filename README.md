# Transformer model Fine-tuning for text classification with Pytorch Lightning

In this repository we present code to do finetuning with transformer models such as BERT, Distilbert and Albert in combination with pytorch lightning.

There is an accompanying blog post https://arthought.com/transformer-model-fine-tuning-for-text-classification-with-pytorch-lightning/
