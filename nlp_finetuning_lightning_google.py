# Remark: pl.LightningModule is derived from torch.nn.Module It has additional methods that are part of the
# lightning interface and that need to be defined by the user. Having these additional methods is very useful
# for several reasons:
# 1. Reasonable Expectations: Once you know the pytorch-lightning-system you more easily read other people's
#    code, because it is always structured in the same way
# 2. Less Boilerplate: The additional class methods make pl.LightningModule more powerful than the nn.Module
#    from plain pytorch. This means you have to write less of the repetitive boilerplate code
# 3. Perfact for the development lifecycle Pytorch Lightning makes it very easy to switch from cpu to gpu/tpu.
#    Further it supplies method to quickly run your code on a fraction of the data, which is very useful in
#    the development process, especially for debugging
